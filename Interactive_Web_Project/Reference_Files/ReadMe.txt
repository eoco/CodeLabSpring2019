There are source files in here for both Section 1 and the final project. They are here if you run into trouble with your own code to refer to.

As tempting as it might be, do not copy-paste into your own work. I know that typing is a drag, but the point of doing this is to learn how to code, which means typing it out, making mistakes, and solving those mistakes. I am quite confident you know how to copy and paste, so that is not the point :)
